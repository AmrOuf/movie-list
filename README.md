# Movie List Application

This is a movie list application made in ES6 to make a list of your favourite movies. The way it works is it takes a movie title, year of release, and the director, then prints the output title in front of you on the screen. If you choose to remove a certain movie from the list you can always do that.

The list you made is kept in the local storage of the browser so the list is saved even if you close the browser tab or reload it again.

The application layout is made in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You can try the application here: http://bit.ly/2z3JZAW
